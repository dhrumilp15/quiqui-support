# quiqui-support

This repo is the support repo to my who-is-who([Qui qui](https://github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui)) app for CCExtractor

Currently, it builds the compressed files that the app uses based on your input!

If you don't want to use this tool and just want to insert your own .zip file into the app, upload it to [Qui Qui Images](https://github.com/dhrumilp15/quiqui_imgs)
